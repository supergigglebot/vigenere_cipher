Message Encoder/Decoder using the Vigenere Cipher

This program allows for encoding and decoding messages using the Vigenere Cipher. It asks for the input of a keyword, and text to be encoded/decoded.

The Vigenere Cipher was my favorite one as a kid (nerd alert) because of how resistant it was to cryptanalysis. If you are unfamiliar with how it works, Check it out here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher
The (very basic) gist is that you and your cohorts each have a password, and only inputting the correct password will produce the decoded message. This doesn't really touch on how cool the cipher really is, so I highly recommend reading up on it.

Anyway, this works. Just choose to encode or decode, input your keyword, and input your message. It will spit out your encoded or decoded message to be used as you will. Enjoy.
